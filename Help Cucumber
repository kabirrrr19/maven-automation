Cucumber Options
Dry Run
dryRun option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means that Cucumber will only check that every Step mentioned in the Feature File has corresponding code written in Step Definition file or not.

Monochrome
This option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the Cucumber test are much more readable

Features
Features Options helps Cucumber to locate the Feature file in the project folder structure. 

Glue
It is almost the same think as Features Option but the only difference is that it helps Cucumber to locate the Step Definition file
